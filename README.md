# Automatic-Trailer-Generation
This repository contains all the relevant information about my internship project: Automatic Trailer Generation.
The goal of the project is to generate trailer for an input movie automatically. I used tools such as Google Cloud Platform, AUdio Video processing using python libraries such as librosa, pydub, ffmpeg etc. to implement this project. My code is robust to the genres of the movie. It generates effective trailers for movies of any genre be it thriller, action, comedy or horror. The project is divided into four major pipelines:
1) Impresive Speech Detection
2) Impressive Scenes Detection
3) Theme Music Extraction
4) Stitching all the above three parts in an effective and attractive way to generate the trailer.


All the relevant information regarding the code is given in the "Code Documentation" file present in the Code section of this repository. It contains information about each code file i.e. what are the functions of each code file and what is the input and output format of each code file.


To implement the project from beginning to end, see the "Order of Execution of Code Files" pdf present in the Code section of this repository. It contains all the information about what is the correct ofrder of execution of the code files.

Some sample trailers generated by my code are present in the "Trailers" folder in the Code section.
