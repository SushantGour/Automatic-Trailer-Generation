This repository contains all the relevant information about my internship project: Automatic Trailer Generation.
The goal of the project is to generate trailer for an input movie automatically. I used tools such as Google Cloud Platform, AUdio Video processing using python libraries such as librosa, pydub, ffmpeg etc. to implement this project. My code is robust to the genres of the movie. It generates effective trailers for movies of any genre be it thriller, action, comedy or horror. The project is divided into four major pipelines:
1) Impresive Speech Detection
2) Impressive Scenes Detection
3) Theme Music Extraction
4) Stitching all the above three parts in an effective and attractive way to generate the trailer.
